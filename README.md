# C-.Number-of-Registrants.Total-Amount-Owed
Create a program that displays the total amount of money a company owes for a seminar. The seminar per person is based on the number of people the company registers. For example, if the company registers seven people, then the total amount owed by the company is P2800. If the user enters the number 0 or a negative number, the program should display an appropriate error message.
